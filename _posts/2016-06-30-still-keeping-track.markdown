I know the lists are getting unwieldy, but hopefully this puts an end to the incessant-but-partial lists I've been making the past few days! Just trying to get everything in order â€“ because I keep using "don't yet have a functional website/blog" as an excuse for doing all the reading that I actually want to do this summer.

# Post-related things
* <del>**Fix post layout**</del>
* <del>**Install pagination**</del>
* <del>Reformat blockquotes</del>
* <del>Reformat heading formats for in-post use</del>
* Set up tag indexing
* Make tag display clicky
* [Figure out "Read More" function](https://answers.squarespace.com/questions/83467/adding-read-more-in-adversary.html)
* Uh, link colors...

# General things
* <del>**Make ok-looking footer**</del>
* Trim down code (centralize color variables)
* Make linky social media icons

# Less important misc things
* [Javascript for smooth scroll to anchor](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll)
* Format images on Work page
* Populate About page with real stuff
* Better color scheme
* Reformat code display for footnotes (maybe?)

Tomorrow, if I end up having any time to work on this at all, I'm going to try to fix the post layout first and foremost, which may take a while. Then, figure out the footer stuff (which shouldn't take *ages*) before I try to tackle pagination, which will be thorny.

When that's over, though, hopefully it'll be relatively smooth sailing from there. Just a few small things to fix up before I can start writing/posting! Good stuff.
